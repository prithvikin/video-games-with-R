## Introduction

Video games have become the basis of millions of childhoods across the
world. Generations can attest to ubiquitous Pacman, legendary Zelda, the
adventurous Mario Brothers, and brave Master Chief. From these legends
have arisen corporate conglomerates, cutting-edge computational power,
and a yearning fanbase.

However, what pushes some games to the top and others to crash? What
platforms are more “violent?” What region loves their sacred controllers
and game cartridges the most? Would releasing a game in North America be
more beneficial than releasing in Japan? Although these are questions of
an over-achieving gamer, the quest was to get the bottom of some of them
with R and a public dataset.

### Data
